# Assumptions
# - B2: Storage $5/TB/mo, Class C writes $0.004/10k, Egress free for first 3x storage/month then $0.01/GB
# - R2: Storage $15/TB/mo, Class B writes $3.60/million, Zero egress
# - S3: Storage $23/TB/mo, PUT $0.005/1k, Egress $0.09/GB
# - API Requests: Uploads + metadata lookups (~10k per 1TB of photos = ~500 photos @ 2GB each)
# - CDN: Cloudflare free tier for caching, $50/mo beyond 1TB bandwidth (conservative estimate)
# - Cache Hit Ratio: 95% assumed (CDN serves most thumbnails from cache)

# Breakeven Analysis
# - B2 cheaper until egress > 60TB/month (3x storage for 20TB)
# - R2 cheaper when: (R2_storage - B2_storage) < B2_egress_cost
# - For 20TB: R2 saves $220.80 - $307.20 = B2 wins UNLESS egress > 10TB/mo consistently
# - Hybrid wins at scale: originals rarely accessed (B2), thumbnails served via R2 (zero egress)
