# MVP Roadmap & Sprint Plan

## Product Vision

Build a privacy-first photo service that rivals Google Photos in features while giving users full control over their data, at 1/10th the infrastructure cost through smart architecture choices.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: MVP - Core Upload & View (Weeks 1-6)

**Goal**: Users can upload photos, view timeline, and share albums

**Features**:
- ✅ User registration & JWT auth
- ✅ Direct browser→B2 uploads via presigned URLs
- ✅ Thumbnail generation (256px, 512px, 1024px) in WebP/JPEG
- ✅ Timeline view (sorted by date taken)
- ✅ Basic albums (create, add photos, share link)
- ✅ PWA installable (manifest + service worker)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. User can register and login
2. Upload 10 MB photo → thumbnails ready within 30s
3. Timeline loads 20 thumbnails in < 1s (4G network)
4. Duplicate photo detected based on SHA256 (shows "Already uploaded")
5. Album shared via link → recipient can view (no login required)
6. PWA installs on Android Chrome (Add to Home Screen prompt)
7. Unit tests cover 80% of backend code
8. Load test: 500 concurrent uploads/min for 10 min without queue backlog growth

**Team**:
- 1 Backend Engineer (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Celery)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (React PWA, service worker)
- 1 DevOps/SRE (GCP, Terraform, K8s)
- 0.5 QA Engineer (manual + automated tests)

**Person-Weeks**: 18 (6 weeks × 3 full-time engineers)

---

### Milestone 2: Search & EXIF (Weeks 7-9)

**Goal**: Users can search photos by date, location, camera model

**Features**:
- ✅ EXIF extraction (date, GPS, camera metadata)
- ✅ Location reverse geocoding (GPS → city name)
- ✅ Text search (caption, location, camera model)
- ✅ Date range filter
- ✅ Location-based search (within radius)
- ✅ Favorites and archive

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. EXIF data extracted and displayed in photo detail view
2. Search for "San Francisco" returns matching photos (GPS or caption)
3. Date filter: "Photos from 2024-06" works correctly
4. Location search: "Photos within 10km of lat/lng" returns results in < 500ms
5. Favorite/archive state persists and filters work

**Team**: Same as M1 (2.5 full-time engineers)

**Person-Weeks**: 7.5 (3 weeks × 2.5 engineers)

---

### Milestone 3: Face Grouping (Opt-In) (Weeks 10-13)

**Goal**: Users can auto-group photos by people (explicit opt-in)

**Features**:
- ✅ Privacy UI: Explicit opt-in checkbox with clear explanation
- ✅ Face detection (RetinaFace or MTCNN)
- ✅ Face embedding (InsightFace ArcFace, 512-dim)
- ✅ Clustering (DBSCAN, stored in pgvector)
- ✅ Name faces (user-assigned labels)
- ✅ Search by person ("Show all photos of Mom")

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. User opts in → faces detected in uploaded photos
2. Faces grouped automatically (min 3 faces per cluster)
3. User can name clusters (e.g., "John")
4. Search "John" returns all photos with that face (cosine similarity > 0.6)
5. User opts out → all face data deleted within 24hr
6. Face detection completes within 2 min of upload (GPU worker)

**Team**: 
- 1 Backend Engineer (face ML pipeline)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (opt-in UI, face management)
- 0.5 ML Engineer (model evaluation, tuning)

**Person-Weeks**: 10 (4 weeks × 2.5 engineers)

---

### Milestone 4: Advanced Sharing & Permissions (Weeks 14-16)

**Goal**: Password-protected shares, download control, analytics

**Features**:
- ✅ Password-protected share links (bcrypt)
- ✅ Download enable/disable toggle
- ✅ Share analytics (view count, download count, visitor IPs)
- ✅ Expiry customization (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, never)
- ✅ Revoke share link

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Password-protected share: Visitor must enter correct password to view
2. Download disabled: Visitor sees thumbnails but can't download originals
3. Share analytics: Owner sees view/download counts per photo
4. Expired share: Visitor sees "This link has expired"
5. Revoked share: Link stops working immediately

**Team**: Same as M1 (2.5 full-time engineers)

**Person-Weeks**: 7.5 (3 weeks × 2.5 engineers)

---

### Milestone 5: Performance & Scale (Weeks 17-20)

**Goal**: System handles 10k photos/day, 1k concurrent users

**Features**:
- ✅ CDN caching optimized (95%+ hit ratio)
- ✅ Read replicas for PostgreSQL (async replication)
- ✅ Horizontal autoscaling (HPA for workers, Cloud Run for API)
- ✅ Rate limiting (Cloudflare Workers)
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards (Grafana)
- ✅ Alerting (PagerDuty for critical, Slack for warnings)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Load test: 1000 concurrent users → p95 latency < 500ms
2. Upload test: 10k photos in 24hr → all processed within 1hr
3. CDN cache hit ratio > 95% (checked via Cloudflare Analytics)
4. Auto-scaling: Workers scale from 2 → 20 pods under load, back to 2 when idle
5. Alert triggers when queue depth > 100 for 10 min
6. Database read replica lag < 1s (checked via monitoring)

**Team**:
- 1 Backend Engineer (optimization, caching)
- 1 DevOps/SRE (scaling, monitoring)
- 0.5 QA Engineer (load testing)

**Person-Weeks**: 10 (4 weeks × 2.5 engineers)

### Milestone 6: Mobile & Offline (Weeks 21-24)

**Goal**: Robust PWA with offline uploads, iOS support

**Features**:
- ✅ Service worker background sync (Android)
- ✅ Offline upload queue persists across app restarts
- ✅ iOS Add to Home Screen guidance
- ✅ iOS foreground sync workaround (Visibility Change event)
- ✅ Network status indicator
- ✅ Retry failed uploads

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Android: Upload while offline → auto-syncs when network returns
2. iOS: Upload queue shown on app open → user manually triggers sync
3. Failed upload: Retry button works, succeeds on subsequent attempt
4. Network indicator: Shows "Offline" banner when disconnected
5. IndexedDB persists 50 pending uploads without eviction

| pgvector performance | Slow queries at scale (>10M embeddings) | Create HNSW index, consider Pinecone if needed |
| iOS PWA limitations | No Background Sync | Visibility Change workaround, educate users |
| Face recognition accuracy | False positives annoy users | Conservative clustering (eps=0.4), allow manual split/merge |
| Storage cost growth | Unexpected traffic spikes | Monitor closely, implement tiered storage (hot/cold) |
