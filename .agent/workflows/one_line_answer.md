description: Give a quick, straight-forward one-line answer to the question that follows
---

Answer the user's question in **one concise line**. Do not elaborate, do not add caveats, do not provide code blocks or bullet points unless absolutely necessary to convey the answer. Keep it direct and to the point.

## Rules

1. Your entire answer must fit in a single sentence or short phrase.
2. Do not ask clarifying questions — use your best judgment.
3. If the question is about code in the workspace, quickly look up the relevant file/symbol to give an accurate answer.
4. No preamble, no follow-up suggestions — just the answer.
